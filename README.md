# Heart-disease-in-USA-Data-Analysis
Heart disease is the number one cause of death globally. Heart disease is concertedly contributed by hypertension, diabetes, overweight and unhealthy lifestyles. This data dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
